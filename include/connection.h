 * @brief Connection management.
 *
 * @details connection.h declares declares global variables and provides the user
 * with some functions to manage the connection between GranaSAT server and GranaSAT client.
 * It includes variables to store the different socket file descriptors, as well as a variable
 * to control the connection losses and ensure that both the server and the client are connected.
 * 
 * The connection between the client and the server is divided in three channels, that are created
 * through three different ports. The communication channels are the following:
 *
 * -# A command socket, where the client write commands and the server reads them.
 * -# A big data socket, where the server writes the images taken from the camera and the client
 * receives them.
 * -# A small data socket, where the server writes the smallest packets of data and the client
 * receives them. Through this socket, the following data is exchanged:
 *		-# Magnetometer and accelerometer measurements.
 *		-# Temperature sensor measurements.
 *		-# Attitude measurements.
 * 
 * The connection error handling is now controlled only from getData() and sendData() functions.
 * It could be improved in the future.
