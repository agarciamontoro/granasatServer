 * error() prints an error message to stderr, labeled as CONNECTION, using printMsg() function.
 * Depending on @p status, error() forces the disconnection of all communication channels

 * pointed by @p msg, another message is output to stderr, also labeled as CONNECTION, noticing
 * the disconnection.
 * 
 * This function is usually called after an error is detected from send() or recv() functions, as
 * well as from bind() or socket(). This function has to be called with @p status set to zero if,
 * and only if, the connection is intended to be finished, because an error is encountered or because
 * the user wants the connection to be manually finished.
