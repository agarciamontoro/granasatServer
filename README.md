### Flight

The experiment flew, successfully, the night of 8 October 2014. Thousands of good images were collected, both for the Horizon Sensor and for the Star Tracker. The scientific and technical results will be exposed in the 22nd ESA Symposium on European Rocket and Balloon Programme & related Research, 7-12 June 2015.
In the meanwhile, enjoy the aurora borealist captured by our camera from the stratosphere:
